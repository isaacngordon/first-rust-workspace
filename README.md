# LLM Assited Learning Rust (My First Rust Workspace)
Learning Rust using ChatGPT

## Motivation
- Sick of bouncing between languages and re-writing code
- YouTube channel No Boilerplate makes some pretty persuasive arguements regarding Rust and "oxidizing" one's tools and workflow.
- Additionally, the dank compiler seems like a world class supervisor for AI Agents that write code. 


## Other Inspiration
- "Hello, Cruel World" series by James
- IndyCodeDev's TTYB series
